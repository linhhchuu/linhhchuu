### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently doing my masters in Business Analytics at University of Southern California. 

- ðŸ’¡ My background is in digital marketing and I really enjoy learning about applying statistics and analytics techniques to support data in launching campaigns and products. I spent 3 years in paid media within the field of e-commerce & app marketing, where I went through roles in ad operations and planning, and ended up enjoying the analytics work the most. 

- ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm working on some projects on Marketing and Product Analytics.
