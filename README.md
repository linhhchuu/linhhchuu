## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Linh Chu, currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics at the University of Southern California.

ðŸ’¡ I come from a digital marketing background and spent 3 years working in paid media for e-commerce and app-based businesses. From ad operations to campaign planning, I eventually found my passion in the analytics side of thingsâ€”turning performance data into actionable insights.

ðŸ“Š These days, I'm diving deep into **Marketing Analytics**, **Product Analytics**, and **Causal Inference**, building data science projects that explore how data can guide smarter campaigns and better product decisions.

ðŸŒ± Always learning, always testing. Letâ€™s connect!
