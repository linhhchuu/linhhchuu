### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Linh Chu, and I am currently a MS. Business Analytics candidate at University of Southern California. Before grad school, I spent 3 years in performance marketing within the field of e-commerce & app marketing, where I enjoy crunching metrics along the conversion funnel to guide acquisition & retention campaign based on customer insights. Right now, I'm building upon my domain knowledge towards Marketing Science & Analytics.
